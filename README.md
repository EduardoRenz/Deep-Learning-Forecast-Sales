# Deep-Learning-Forecast-Sales
A Keras LSTM model to predict future sales

This is a [Deep Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) project to predict future sales from a fashion company.

For Forecasting, its used a type of Neural Network Called [Long short-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)

For this project, the language it's python and the library for I.A is [Keras](https://keras.io/) with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) BackEnd
